Welcome to GEMmaker's documentation!
====================================

GEMmaker is a `Nextflow <https://www.nextflow.io/>`__ workflow for large-scale gene expression sample processing, expression-level quantification and Gene Expression Matrix (GEM) construction. Results from GEMmaker are useful for differential gene expression (DGE) and gene co-expression network (GCN) analyses. The GEMmaker workflow currently supports Illumina RNA-seq datasets.
